# CLEETS-SMART [South Wales]: Towards a Support System for Electric Vehicles Travel Planning During Extreme Weather Events

Vehicles Travel Planning During Extreme Weather Events  

A decision support dashboard is proposed for South Wales in the United Kingdom to reduce range anxiety and enable safer and more resilient EV travel planning during extreme weather events. The dashboard integrates heterogeneous data sources, including the UK National ChargePoint Registry, Welsh Government flood-risk layers, and 24-hour forecasts from the Met Office DataHub and the Open-Meteo API as a fallback. Users specify trip origin, destination, and battery State-Of-Charge (SOC); the dashboard then simulates routes, highlights exposure risks, and recommends safe charging stops. Two routing modes are supported: an exact Resource Constrained Shortest Path (RCSP) solver, which provides charge-feasible routes that minimize travel time and flood exposure; and a fallback Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) mode, which returns only the fastest path and overlays flood warnings, without guaranteeing feasibility or optimality.

A Dash + Folium web app that integrates:  
- **Welsh Government flood-risk maps** (FRAW, FMfP, live warnings via GeoServer).  
- **UK National ChargePoint Registry (NCR) data** for public EV chargers.  
- **Met Office DataHub and Open-Meteo forecasts** for 24-hour conditions.  
- **Journey simulator** with exact RCSP routing + fallback OSRM.  
- **Chatbot explanations** for transparency and scenario testing.  

Chargers are visualised with overlays for flood zones, live warnings, and weather impact.

## Features  
- **Live flood overlays** (FRAW, FMfP, NRW warnings).  
- **EV journey simulator**: RCSP solver (battery-aware) + fallback OSRM routes.
  ## Journey Simulator Steps
  ![RCSP Solver](RCSP.jpg)
  
1. **Build the road network**
   - Model the map as a graph $G=(V,E)$ with nodes $V$ (intersections/chargers) 
     and edges $E$ (road segments).
   - Each edge $e$ has: length $d_e$, driving time $t^{\mathrm{drive}}_e$, 
     and a flood flag $F_e \in \{0,1\}$ (1 if flooded/penalized).

2. **Energy model per edge**
   - Energy used on edge $e$: $\Delta E_e = \kappa d_e$ (kWh), where $\kappa$ is 
     average consumption (kWh/km).
   - State of charge (SOC) update: $q' = q - \Delta E_e / B$, where $B$ is 
     battery capacity (kWh).  
     Enforce minimum reserve: $q' \ge q_{\min}$.

3. **Travel cost per edge**
   - Cost combines drive time and flood penalty:  
     $c_e = t^{\mathrm{drive}}_e + \lambda d_e F_e$.  
     Flooded edges ($F_e=1$) get an extra penalty proportional to length.

4. **Charging decision at nodes**
   - If SOC would drop below reserve before the next node, add a charging stop at node $v$.
   - Charging time:  
     $t^{\mathrm{chg}}(q,q';v) = \frac{B(q'-q)}{P_v}\times 3600$ seconds,  
     where $P_v$ is charger power (kW) and 3600 converts hours → seconds.  
     Enforce $q' \le 1$ and $q' \ge q$.

5. **Route objective (RCSP)**
   - Minimize total travel cost:  
     $\min \sum_{e \in \text{path}} c_e + \sum_{\text{stops } v} t^{\mathrm{chg}}(q,q';v)$  
     subject to SOC dynamics and reserve constraints.

6. **Two ways to compute routes**
   - (i) Use OSRM to compute a baseline route and time.  
   - (ii) Solve an exact resource-constrained shortest path (RCSP) on OSMnx graphs 
     to jointly optimize path and charging stops under SOC and flood penalties.

7. **High-level workflow**
   - Start with initial SOC $q_0$.  
   - For each candidate path, propagate SOC (step 2), insert charging (step 4), 
     and accumulate cost (steps 3 & 4).  
   - RCSP picks the feasible path/charging plan with minimum cost while avoiding flooded edges.

- **Weather forecasts** from Met Office/Open-Meteo, shown alongside maps.  
- **Downloadable routes** with summaries of time, distance, charging stops, and risk level.
